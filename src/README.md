## Coding files
This contains the main coding document that we use, which is called main.R. Running it installs the relevant libraries, queries data on the Pineneedle Milkweed from gbif, creates a csv. file and produces a Species Occurence Map and a Species Distribution Model.

- pineneedle-sdm-single.R contains the specific code to make a Species Distribution Model, from Jeff Oliver.
- sdm-functions.R and the setup.R are files complementing this process, also from Jeff Oliver.
- linaria-spocc.R contains code for producing a Species Occurence Map
- linaria-sdm-single.R contains code for producing a Species Distribution Model
- linaria-future-sdm-single.R contains code for producing a Species Distribution Model for 2070 climate data
