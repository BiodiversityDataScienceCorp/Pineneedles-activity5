## Species Description:
*A. linaria* is a rare milkweed species in the US, but common and found throughout
Mexico. It can grow up to 4 feet tall, but is typically around 2 feet tall.
It flowers in the spring and summer annually. It has small, white flowers, woody stems, and needle-shaped leaves. Small plants are sometimes mistaken for juvenile pine trees. It is readily availble for commercial planting in the desert Southwest. 

## Habitat Description:
- Dry rocky slopes and mesas
- elevation: 1500-6000ft

## Larval Host Information:
It is known to be a host plant for monarch butterflies, Queen Butterflies (will feed on other wildflowers instead) and other pollinators. However, it is used only occasionally due to its relative toxicity (Nabhan et al., 2015). In a study comparing *A. linaria* with *Danus plexippus*, another native milkweed to Arizona, female monarchs preferred to lay on *D. plexippus*, had greater larvae survival rates, faster larval development, and reached a larger adult size on *D. plexippus*. However, this leaves many other milkweed species unevaluated, with uncertaintiy as to if *A. linaria* would be preferred compared with others (Pegram and Melkonoff, 2019). Additionally, unpublished data shows that five times more honeybees, *Apis mellifera*, visited *A. linaria* than *D. plexippus* (Pegram and Melkonoff, 2019).

## Species Distribution Model
### Description of SDM
- The Species Distribution Model map uses bioclim data with occurence data from 1950-2021 to show the areas that are most adept to supporting Pineneedle milkweed (*Asclepias linaria*). The orange displays the species occurence data (sourced from GBIF and iNaturalist). The grey represents the areas in which Pineneedle Milkweed could theoretically grow accordng to the areas climate.
### Methods for SDM
- the SDM (what we did/workflow) (specify Jeff Oliver at end)

### Description of Future SDM
- The Future Species Disribution Model map uses Worldclim forcast climate data for the year 2070 based on the GFDL-ESM2G model with an RCP of 4.5 CO<sub>2</sub>. The orange points represent the current species occurences for Pineneedle Milkweed for the years 1950-2020. The grey represents the Species Disripution Model projections for the year 2070.
### Methods for Future SDM
- Using forcast climate data from Worldclim and the GFDL-ESM2G model
