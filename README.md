# Pineneedle readme
## Overview
- Creating Species Occurence Maps and Species Distribution Models for Species Status Assessment of Monarch Butterflies
- [Species Status Assessment Asclepias linaria](https://github.com/BiodiversityDataScienceCorp/Pineneedles-main-repo/blob/d58107fdebd9162250135d2f8705416b4cc4ae2a/Asclepias-linaria-SSA.md)
- Team Pineneedle (Claire, Mila, Moritz), Spring 2022
- With the help of code by Jeff Oliver https://github.com/jcoliver/biodiversity-sdm-lesson

## Dependencies 
The following  R packages are required (these will be installed by running the setup script, src/setup.R):
- raster
- sp
- dismo
- maptools
- spocc
- rgdal
- sf
- tidyverse
- maps

## Structure

+ SSA.md: Species Status Assessment for Monarch Butterfly hostplant Pineneedle Milkweed
+ Run code with at least 2Gb of RAM
+ data
  + wc2-5: climate data at 2.5 minute resolution from [WorldClim](http://www.worldclim.org) (_note_: this folder is not under version control, but will be created by running the setup script (`scr/setup.R`))
  + cmip5: forcast climate data at 2.5 minute resolution from [WorldClim](http://www.worldclim.org). The data are for the year 2070, based on the GFDL-ESM2G model with an RCP of 4.5 CO<sub>2</sub>. For an examination of different forecast models, see [McSweeney et al. 2015](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00382-014-2418-8). (_note_: this folder is not under version control, but will be created by running the setup script (`scr/setup.R`))
  + MilkweedCombo.csv: data harvested from [GBIF](https://www.gbif.org/) and [iNaturalist](https://www.inaturalist.org) for _Pineneedle Milkweed_. This dataset is not under version control, but will be harvested by running src/main.R.
+ output (contents are not under version control)
  + pineneedleMilkweedspocc.jpg
  + linaria-single-current-sdm.jpg
  + linaria-single-future-sdm.jpg
+ src (directory containing R scripts for gathering occurrence data, running forecast models, and creating map outputs)
  + main.R: this queries data from INAT and GBIF, and creates a csv. file from the data. It then produces a species occurence map and a current and future species distribution model
  + setup.R: this installs important libraries and the worldclim data
  + sdm-functions.R: this prepares the data to be used for creating a SDM
  + linaria-sdm-single.R: this creates a SDM for current climate conditions
  + linaria-future-sdm-single.R: this creates a SDM for 2070 climate conditions
 

## Running the code
- open the src/main.R document
- run the first line of code, source(file = "src/setup.R"), to install all libraries. you might have to restart R in the process
- run the rest of the main.R document (consider runnning the last two lines of code, source "src/linaria-sdm-single.R" and source "src/linaria-future-sdm-single.R", seperately)
- the created maps will be in the output folder
